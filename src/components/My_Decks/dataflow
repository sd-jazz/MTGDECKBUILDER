SQL stores the data as a string ""
JSON.parse converts that string into an object

decks: [ ]
Container of all decks which are arrays named deck.

deck: [ ]
Contains cards that are objects 

card: { }
Contains all the information from the card 


UPDATE????

Target I want to change: decks.deck_name 

Change to: Whatever is in the input field when I click "Save Deck Name" 

Challenges: 

- Multiple input fields, how to manage this with change handlers?  
- Do the input fields need to manipulate state?  If so, how do I have state for each one?
